# Consider a "word" as any sequence of capital letters A-Z (not limited to just "dictionary words"). For any word with at least two different letters, 
# there are other words composed of the same letters but in a different order (for instance, STATIONARILY/ANTIROYALIST, which happen to both be 
# dictionary words; for our purposes "AAIILNORSTTY" is also a "word" composed of the same letters as these two). 
# We can then assign a number to every word, based on where it falls in an alphabetically sorted list of all words made up of the same set of letters. 
# Write a program which takes a word as a command line argument and prints to standard output its number. Do not use the method above of generating 
# the entire list. Your program should be able to accept any word 20 letters or less in length (possibly with some letters repeated), and should use 
# no more than 1 GB of memory and take no more than 500 milliseconds to run. Any answer we check will fit in a 64-bit integer. 
# Sample words, with their rank: ABAB = 2, AAAB = 1, BAAA = 4, QUESTION = 24572,  BOOKKEEPER = 10743, NONINTUITIVENESS = 8222334634.
# Your program will be judged on how fast it runs and how clearly the code is written. We will be running your program as well as reading the source 
# code, so anything you can do to make this process easier would be appreciated.

		# and dividing it by the product of [for each unique character in the string, the factorial of the number of times it occurs in the string]
